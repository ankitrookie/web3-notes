## Tokens / Token Mint
Token is a digital assets createed/deployed on a blockchain.

The folks at USDC, UDDT, Tether haven't created their own blockchain, and 
created their Token. They simpley create on the top of the existing blockchain like solana
eth.

#### The way we create Tokens on SOl and ETh are totelly different :
SOL :: In solana we dont't write our own smart contract to create toekns, we just derive from already writeen/deployed
smart contract by solana folks. We just create an account on top of the contract.

ETH: But the the case of ETH, if we have to create Token we have to create our own smart contract ourselfs and deploy it
in the blockchain.

For more instence : If in future i want to create my own token called AnkitCoin, so what will i do. Call a function on 
the solana smart contract. So that will create new account for me.
