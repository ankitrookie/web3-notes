## Exchnages Jargons
If you see in order book that price of 21.75 solana is 136.89 USDC, it dosent mean the single person is asking for that 
it can be two person that is selling in the same USDC price but different quantity of sol. For ex: let's say person 1 
is selling only 1.75 sol for 136.89 and other peson is selling 20 sol for same USDC which is 136.89. So is is showing 
collectively dosen't mean that the single for is asking for that. 

And if let's say I buy that sol which is 21.75 on 136.89 USDC, now who will get the amount between those two person. So 
for this there are algorithms that decideds this things.
