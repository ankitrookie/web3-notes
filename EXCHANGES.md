## Exchnages Jargons
If you see in order book that price of 21.75 solana is 136.89 USDC, it dosent mean the single person is asking for that 
it can be two person that is selling in the same USDC price but different quantity of sol. For ex: let's say person 1 
is selling only 1.75 sol for 136.89 and other peson is selling 20 sol for same USDC which is 136.89. So is is showing 
collectively dosen't mean that the single for is asking for that. 

And if let's say I buy that sol which is 21.75 on 136.89 USDC, now who will get the amount between those two person. So 
for this there are algorithms that decideds this things.

## Spread 
In exchange the spread is the different between aks price and bid price. for ex: I as a asker, asked 2 lakhs for house
but bidder is willing to pay 1.5 lakhs so the spread is 5 lakhs. 

## Liquidity
Liquidity is how easily you can buy or sell an asset without affecting its price.
Ex: when a big whale come and place large order. They can impact the market.  so they end up eating the order book by a lot. As result the price will spik, coz now there are fewer assest to buy, so remaning price assets will spike. Coz  now supply is low.

So high liquidity means stable prices even with big trades, while low liquidity means prices can change quickly with large orders.

### Liquidity Pools 
Liquidity pools are collection of cryptocurreny/token locked or deployed in the smart contract that is used to facilitate trades. 
```bash
The more the liquidity the better the price.
```

### Constant product algorithem
Lets say Liquidity pool has this much token in total = 3000000
3000 SOL --- 1000 USDC = 3000 * 1000 = 3000000
So now as per formula ==> Lets say someone came and make sol up to 3001 SOL now we have to decrese USDC to make liquidity constant. So now given/added one sol, now how much USDC you can pool out is 1.666. So one sol you are getting for 1.666 USDC.

So now if SOL is lot of supply the price of SOL will decrease and same with otheres tokens.
Same lot of people are buying solan a lot, then SOL price will go up, coz supply is less.
