# Introduction to ETH and EVM

In eth mining happens via Proof of Stacke not via Proof of Wok(which it used to).

## Proof of stake
PoS in eth is a consensuse mechinism(alog for agreement in decentralized networks) that allows validators to create
and verify new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.
