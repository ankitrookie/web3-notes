# Introduction to ETH and EVM

In eth mining happens via Proof of Stacke not via Proof of Wok(which it used to).

## Proof of stake
PoS in eth is a consensuse mechinism(alog for agreement in decentralized networks) that allows validators to create
and verify new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

# World State




# Evm Implementations
Any code that let's you start eth virtual mechine, is what is called an eth client. like for instence : ethereum/go-ethereum, ethereumproject/cpp-ethereum,

# Solidity ABIs, bytecode and opcode

Solidity is a high level programming language designed for writing smart contracts that run on the eth virtual machine.
When we swap one token to another, for ex: eth to usdc and when the that transaction initiated the $20 cut/taking in between/middle is smart contract.

When you compile solidity code, it will generate two thing for you 
1. Bytecode
2. ABIs

Bytecode -> Human-readable code converted into bytes. In the form of 0s & 1s. So bytes is solidity code is compiled.
And that Bytes is sequence of instructions(opcodes) taht can be understood and executed by the eth virtual machine.
